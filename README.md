EXERCISE FOR DEVELOPER CANDIDATES: Unit Number Sorting Exercise

We often deal with unit number / resident name data. These two pieces of information are used by our users to identify a lease. Many of our screens and reports show a list of leases.

The task is to sort lease data read from a file and to print the sorted data to STDOUT. The data looks as follows (sample also attached):
 
* "#50 - Smith"
* "#8 - Johnson"
* "#100 - Sanders"
* "#1B - Adams"
* "#1A - Kessenich"
 
Each line contains a unit number and a resident name. The data should be sorted by unit number.
 
Develop a solution in PHP and one other language of your choice that reads the data from a file and prints the data (sorted by unit number) to STDOUT. The printed strings should not be modified from how they appear in the input file.

#####Stack and Technology
* PHP / Symfony Framework
* Angular
* Bootstrap Components
* Twig
* Linux / Apache

#####How it works
* Symfony returns the page via twig.
* Angular in twig loads the data, data read from "input.txt" and sorted naturally via PHP.
* Twig displays the Angular variables, data.
* Buttons added to allow the data to be sorted a second time, dynamically, via Javascript / Angular.
